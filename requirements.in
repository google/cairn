# Dependency hashes are required by Google internal checkings. So we use
# pip-compile (from pip-tools) to generate requirements.txt from this file.
#
# The command is:
#
#   pip-compile --allow-unsafe --generate-hashes requirements.in
#
pip-tools

# Keep the following in sync with p4c/requirements.txt.
